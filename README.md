<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [PET PALS] <a name="about-project"></a>

> Welcome to PetPals, the ultimate social media platform for pet lovers! Connect, share, and celebrate the joy of your furry friends. Join us today to embark on a pet-inspired journey with PetPals!

**[Pet pals]** is a social media app for pet owners that brings joy and helps them connect with each other. Our app will provide a platform for users to share photos and stories about their pets, find and join pet-related events in their local community, and connect with other pet owners for playdates and pet-sitting arrangements.

### Users:
1. As a busy pet owner, I want to be able to easily find and connect with other pet owners in my area without having to spend a lot of time searching through different websites or social media platforms.
2. As a new dog owner who just moved to a new city, I am feeling lonely and disconnected without my usual social support network. I have been looking for ways to meet other dog owners in her area but haven’t had much luck. I’m excited to try out a social media app for pet owners where I can connect with other dog owners in my neighborhood and set up play dates for my pup.
3. I have a unique pet with special needs and I want to be able to connect with other pet owners who have similar experiences and can offer advice and support.

A user is able to:
-Create an account and user profile and login.
-Create posts and categorize them.
-View the feed to browse other users' posts.
-Interact with other users by liking and commenting on their posts.
